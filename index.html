He then went on to attend the University of Tennessee College of Medicine, where he was awarded the Faculty Medal for achieving the highest academic class rank in his graduating class. He then completed his residency at the Campbell Clinic, which publishes the definitive orthopaedic textbook, Campbell's Operative Orthopaedics. In his final year of residency, he was selected as the Administrative Chief Resident.

Several of his mentors at Emory are world-renowned leaders in the sub-specialty of cervical spine surgery
